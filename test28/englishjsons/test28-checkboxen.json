        "metin": "On intersections of equal roads, a tram driver always has right of way. It does not matter whether he is coming from the left or the right, or approaching you from the front or the back. The rules 'drivers give way to drivers from the right' and 'through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off' do not apply to tram drivers. However, they have to adhere to traffic signs and markings such as priority triangles and priority signs. When you are driving on a priority road and the tram driver is approaching this road from the left or right, he must adhere to the priority triangles and give way to you.",
