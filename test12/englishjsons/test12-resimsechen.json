                "metin": "Overtaking is allowed in the upper right and bottom left situation. In the upper left situation there is sign F-1 next to the road. This indicates that motor vehicles are not allowed to overtake each other. A tractor is also a motor vehicle and may therefore not be overtaken here. In the upper right situation there is no pedestrian crossing (zebra crossing). Overtaking is not prohibited here. In the bottom left situation there is a broken line on your side of the solid line and overtaking is therefore allowed. In the bottom right situation there is fog. This makes overtaking dangerous and therefore prohibited.",
