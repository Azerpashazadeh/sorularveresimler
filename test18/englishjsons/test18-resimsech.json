In the upper left situation only parking is not allowed. In the upper right and bottom right situations you must use a parking disc while parking, but this does not apply while loading or unloading. In the bottom left situation you are not allowed to stop at all, unless you are dropping off or picking up a passenger. Loading and unloading are therefore not allowed here.",

You want to turn off this road, which means you must give way to the pedestrian. In the scenario on the right, the pedestrian is approaching from the left and is therefore not on the same road. The rule 'through traffic on the same road has priority over traffic turning off' does not apply in that case, so the pedestrian has to wait. The priority triangles are irrelevant because they indicate that you must give way to drivers on the intersecting road, and pedestrians are not drivers.",
