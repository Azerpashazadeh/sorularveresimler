As soon as a traffic light is a round bulb and you want to turn left, oncoming traffic can have green at the same time as you, and the rule ‘through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off’ still applies. If traffic lights are out of order, this rule also applies. Only when you approach a traffic light with a green arrow, you can be sure you don't have to let oncoming traffic go first.",
