At the upper left situation you should not pre-sort on the cycle lane because it has a solid line. This also applies to the situation on the bottom left. This last situation is therefore the only wrong answer. In the upper right situation you have to wait for pedestrians who want to cross straight ahead. To avoid standing still on the cycle lane, it is better to pre-sort next to it. In the bottom right situation it is best to pre-sort on the cycle lane to avoid waiting on the vehicle lined up to turn left.",

Overtaking on the right side of the block marking is also allowed, if the vehicle you are overtaking is driving on the left side of that marking. \nOvertaking on the right side is not allowed in the bottom two situations. In the left situation you may not overtake a vehicle that is driving on the left lane unnecessary, you must wait for it to go back to the right lane. In the right situation you are driving on a rush hour lane. You must consider this a normal lane. Overtaking on the right is not allowed, unless there is a traffic jam. This is not the case.",
