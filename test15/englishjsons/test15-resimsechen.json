Because the pedestrian in the upper left situation on the intersecting road is not considered a driver, you do not have to give way to them. In the upper right situation, the pedestrian approaches you from the front. In that case, the rule ‘through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off’ applies and you do have to give way to the pedestrian. In the bottom left situation the ‘short turn goes before long turn’ rule applies, and you can go first because you are turning right and the oncoming car is turning left. In the bottom right situation you have to give way to the driver on the priority road.",

In the bottom left situation there is sign F-1 next to the road. This indicates that motor vehicles are not allowed to overtake each other. A tractor is also a motor vehicle and may therefore not be overtaken here. In the bottom right situation there is a broken line on your side of the solid line and overtaking is allowed.",
