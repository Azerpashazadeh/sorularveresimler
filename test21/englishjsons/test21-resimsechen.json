In the top left situation there are no drivers on the intersecting road. Here the ‘short turn goes before long turn’ rule applies, and you can go first because you are turning right and the oncoming car is turning left. Because the pedestrian in the upper right situation on the intersecting road is not considered a driver, you do not have to give way to them. In the bottom right situation, the pedestrian approaches you from the front. In that case, the rule ‘through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off’ applies and you do have to give way to the pedestrian. In the bottom left situation you have to give way to the driver on the priority road.",
