Overtaking on the right side of the block marking is also allowed, if the vehicle you are overtaking is driving on the left side of that marking. Overtaking on the right side is not allowed in both left situations. In the upper left situation you may not overtake a vehicle that is driving on the left lane unnecessary, you must wait for it to go back to the right lane. In the bottom left situation you are driving on a rush hour lane. You must consider this a normal lane. Overtaking on the right is not allowed, unless there is a traffic jam. This is not the case.",
