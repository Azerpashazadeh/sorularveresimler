It is also not allowed to overtake via a pre-sorting lane of a different direction than you want to follow. Overtaking is also prohibited just before or on a pedestrian crossing. Overtaking is often not safe within a short distance of an intersection with limited visibility, but it is not always prohibited when the visibility is sufficient.",
