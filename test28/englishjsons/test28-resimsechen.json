You want to turn off this road, which means you must give way to the pedestrian. In the scenario on the right, the pedestrian is approaching from the left and is therefore not on the same road. The rule 'through traffic on the same road has priority over traffic turning off' does not apply in that case, so the pedestrian has to wait. The priority triangles are irrelevant because they indicate that you must give way to drivers on the intersecting road, and pedestrians are not drivers.",
