If you are coming from an unpaved road, you must give way to drivers from the left and right on the paved road. A pedestrian is not a driver and must wait. The tractor driver approaches you from the front. The rule ‘through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off’ also applies on unpaved roads. You may therefore go first before the turning tractor. In the bottom two situations, the cyclist comes from the right and the motorcyclist from the left. Both drivers have the right of way because you are coming from the unpaved road. This means you have to let them go first.",
