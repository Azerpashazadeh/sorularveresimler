You are also not allowed to overtake just before or on a pedestrian crossing (zebra crossing). Overtaking is also forbidden in places where it is dangerous, such as just before or at a poorly visible dangerous intersection. In the bottom right situation, overtaking is allowed. The F-3 sign indicates that lorries are not allowed to overtake, but they may be overtaken. The white stripes are interrupted, so you are allowed to cross them. This does not require the green line to be interrupted.",
