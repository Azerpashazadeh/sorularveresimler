However, you are allowed to ride a bicycle.",

In that case you may use dipped headlights, both with or without front fog lights. You can also combine front fog lights with sidelights instead of dipped headlights. Full-beam headlights are not allowed during daytime. Rear fog lights are also not permitted. This is only allowed if the visibility is less than 50 meters.",
