At the upper left you have to wait for pedestrians who want to cross straight ahead. To avoid standing still on the cycle lane, it is better to pre-sort next to it. In the upper right situation it is best to pre-sort on the cycle lane to avoid waiting on the vehicle lined up to turn left. In the bottom left situation, you should not pre-sort on the cycle lane because it has a solid line. This also applies to the situation on the bottom right. This last situation is therefore the only wrong answer.",
