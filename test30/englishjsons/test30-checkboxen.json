This should not be seen as one carriageway with four lanes in one direction. You can recognise this by the block marking and the signs above. The rule that you can only use the two right hand lanes with lorries and longer vehicle combinations, does not apply here. Both directions consist of only two lanes, which may be used by drivers of all listed vehicles.",
