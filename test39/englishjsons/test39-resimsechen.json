In the upper left situation, the cyclist keeps following the roundabout you want to turn off from. Through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off. You must give way to the cyclist. In the upper right situation, you are approaching priority triangles and sign B-6. This means that you should give way to drivers on the intersecting road. You must give way to the blue car. In the lower left situations, you are turning off from the same road the cyclist keeps following. You must give way to the cyclist. In the lower right situation, the moped rider is approaching priority triangles and must give way to drivers on the intersecting road. You do not have to give way to the moped rider.",
