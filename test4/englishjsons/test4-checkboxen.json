Overtaking is not prohibited with crosswinds. However, you do have to take into account the changing wind force when passing another vehicle. This also applies when passing other objects like trees and buildings. Larger vehicles are particularly affected by crosswinds, like lorries and vehicles with a trailer. So keep extra space near these vehicles. On viaducts and bridges, crosswinds are generally even stronger, as the wind is less obstructed here.",
