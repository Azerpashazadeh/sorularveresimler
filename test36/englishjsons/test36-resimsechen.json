In the upper two situations the rush-hour lane is open and you should use it if possible, as you should keep to the right as much as possible. In the bottom two situations, the rush-hour lane is closed and you are not allowed to use the hard shoulder. In that case, only two lanes on the left are available and you should keep to the right lane of these two as much as possible.",
