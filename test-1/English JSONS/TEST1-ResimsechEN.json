Overtaking on the right side of the block marking is also allowed, if the vehicle you are overtaking is driving on the left side of that marking. \nOvertaking on the right side is not allowed in the bottom two situations. In the left situation you may not overtake a vehicle that is driving on the left lane unnecessary, you must wait for it to go back to the right lane. In the right situation you are driving on a rush hour lane. You must consider this a normal lane. Overtaking on the right is not allowed, unless there is a traffic jam. This is not the case.",

Sign C-16 indicates a declaration of closure to pedestrians. So, pedestrians are not allowed to use this road. Sign G-3 indicates an autoweg. Pedestrians are also not allowed here either.",
