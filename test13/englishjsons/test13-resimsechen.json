So in the top left situation you have to give way to the pedestrian. In the bottom left situation you are dealing with a emergency vehicle with flashing lights and siren. You must always give way to emergency vehicles. In the right two situations, you do not have to give way to the car from the left and the pedestrian from the right. You only have to give way to drivers from the right. So not to drivers from the left or pedestrians from the right.",
