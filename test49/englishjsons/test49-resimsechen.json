In the two situations on the left side, the cyclist comes from the right and the motorcyclist from the left. Both drivers have right of way because you are coming from the unpaved road. This means you have to let them go first. In the two situations on the right side, you do not have to give way to the other road user. A pedestrian is not a driver and must wait. The tractor driver approaches you from the front. The rule ‘through traffic on the same road goes before traffic turning off’ also applies on unpaved roads. You may therefore go first before the turning tractor.",
